# Titanic Dataset -> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs an EDA on the famous Titanic dataset to gain insights into passenger characteristics and identify factors influencing survival. It includes cleaning, feature analysis, visualization, and statical insights.

# Goals:
- Explore the structure and contents of the titanic dataset
- Handle missing values properly
- Analyze relationships between passenger features and survival
- Visualize insights

# How to run
1. Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/yasaman483/Titanic-EDA.git
cd Titanic-EDA`

2. Install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Run the jupyter notebook:

`jupyter notebook notebooks/Titanic_EDA.ipynb`

# Key Insights:
* About 61% of passengers didn't survive.
* Most passengers were in the 3rd class.
* Females and children had higher survival rates.
* First-class passengers paid higher fares and were more likely to survive.
